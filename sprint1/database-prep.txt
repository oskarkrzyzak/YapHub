Sprint 1 – Database Prep

Name: Nawar Almuohi
Section/Responsibility: Database

1. Sprint 1 Responsibilities
For Sprint 1, I am responsible for the database-related tasks.
The Trello cards I own are:
- Convert ERD into database schema
- Create tables and insert test data
- Write core database queries for Sprint 1

My goal is to set up a working database structure that the backend
can connect during this sprint.

2. Setup Steps
1. Install MySQL locally on my machine.
2. Install MySQL Workbench.
3. Create a local MySQL database for the project.
4. Create SQL files to store table creation and test data.
5. Run the SQL files to make sure the database works correctly.

Tools used:
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub

3. Development Plan
Step 1: Look at the ERD provided by the team.
Step 2: Identify the tables and columns needed.
Step 3: Write CREATE TABLE statements in SQL.
Step 4: Add primary keys and foreign keys.
Step 5: Insert sample test data into each table.
Step 6: Write basic SELECT queries needed for Sprint 1.
Step 7: Test all SQL commands in MySQL Workbench.

Files I expect to work on:
- database/schema.sql
- database/seed.sql
- database/queries.sql

Done means:
- Tables are created successfully
- Test data is inserted without errors
- Queries run and return correct results

4. Risks or Questions
- Changes to the ERD may require updates to the tables.
- Need confirmation from backend on required fields.
- Need team agreement on table and column names.
