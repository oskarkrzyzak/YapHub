CMPSC 390 – Lab 4
Sprint 2 Planning: Vertical Feature Ownership
Purpose of This Lab
Today is planning only.
You are not building the feature yet.
You are designing, scoping, and committing to a vertical feature you will fully own in Sprint 2.
By the end of class you will:
* Define one independently demoable vertical feature
* Scope it realistically
* Write a complete feature brief
* Create a Sprint 2 Trello feature card
* Open a planning Pull Request
This is the official transition from layer teams to full stack feature ownership.
________________


Learning Objective
You will move from:
Sprint 1
Frontend team
Backend team
Database team
To:
Sprint 2
Each developer owns one complete feature
Each feature touches multiple layers
Each feature can be demoed independently
No shared ownership.
No partial layers.
No dependency chains.


Part 1: Feature Definition
As a team, each team member must define:
1. Feature Name -- (Comments on a post)

2. User Story -- as a user I would like to comment on a post so that I can respond to what someone shared.
Format:


3. Why this adds value to the project
Comments would bring interactions on posts and make YapHub feel like a real social platform


4. What layers it touches:
The layers this would include are UI, Backend, and Database


Constraints
* No duplicate features
* No shared features
* No “this only works if their feature works”
* Must be demoable alone
If your feature depends on another feature, it is invalid.










Part 2: Feature Brief Documentation
On your personal branch:
nameDev
Create:
sprint2
Inside that folder:
feature-[shortname].txt
Example:
feature-password-reset.txt
feature-admin-approval.txt
Each person creates their own document on their own branch.
Your Feature Document Must Include

1. Problem Statement
What problem does this solve? YapHub right now has users, posts, and follows, but posts doesnt have any interactions.
This feature will add comments so users can submit a comment on any post and look at already existing comments.
Comments should be saved into the database and still be seem even after reloads.




2. User Flow
Step by step from start to finish
-User opens a comment page for a post.
-Comments that already exist for that post is being displayed.
-User will type a comment and click submit
-Frontend will send the comment to Backend
-Backedn will make sure the the input is good and inserts the comment into the database
-Frontend reloads the comment section and shows the new comment
-reloading the comment page still shows the comment.



3. Technical Plan
Frontend changes
-Creates a simple comment page with a comments list and the comment form
-Uses a placeholder values for the demo
-After submitting it refreshes the comments list

Backend routes
-GET/posts post_id/comments will return all comments for a post
-POST /comments will create a new comment

Database changes
- Create a new comments table
-Inserting test comments for the demo

Files expected to be created or modified
-The backend server file adding GET and POST route
-Frontend file in the code folder will have comments page and javascript
-Database will have a CREATE TABLE comments and have test INSERT statements

4. API Changes
New routes
Modified routes
Request and response structure

-GET/posts post_id/comments
-post_id comes from the URL
-returning a list of comments for that post

to get the comment
-POST /comments
 -takes the post_id, user_id, and the content from the form
 -Makes a success message if the comment has been saved
 -gives an error if something is missing


5. Database Changes
New tables
Schema updates
New fields

Creating a new table called comments
-The fields in the table
 - comment_id
 - post_id
 - user_id
 - content (the text in the comment)
 - created_at (date of when the comment was made)


6. Acceptance Criteria
Clear definition of done
Must be testable
Example:
   * User can submit form
   * Data saves in database
   * Reload shows persisted data
   * Error handling works
   * Feature can be demoed without another feature
If it cannot be demoed independently, it is not scoped correctly.

///
- Comments table is existing with a FK to posts and users
- Users can submit a comment from the UI
- Submitting creates a new row in the comments table.
- GET route returns comments for a post and UI displays them.
- Reload shows the comments are still going.
- Empty comments are rejected with errors
- Feature can be demoed independently while using a placeholder post_id and user_id
  with the test data




Part 3: Trello Sprint 2 Setup
Each team member must:
   * Create One/Multiple Sprint 2 Feature card
   * Assign themselves as owner
   * Break into checklist tasks
Checklist must include:
   * UI tasks
   * Backend tasks
   * Database tasks
   * Testing tasks
OR
You can create a card for each one and assign yourself to it




Submission: EACH PERSON in your group upload your feature-[shortname].txt file to Canvas.
